        "description": "When I first heard about Turing I was disillusioned about not really having a carrier path and had no idea of what I really wanted to do. When my best friend's cousin told me about Turing and becoming a Software Engineer I was intrigued. When I looked into it I felt more and more motivated to go, so I applied, took the interview, and got accepted into the Backend Program. Turing is A Seven Month, Full-Time coding bootcamp. On average I'd spend 65+ Hours a Week attending class, taking notes, coding challenges, and working on the constantly changing projects. It's been the hardest thing I have done up to now but the journey was rewarding. The Turing culture was great and welcoming, my cohort basically became a family and we supported each other though out the journey. I now have a more positive outlook for my future."

        "description": "I attended Miami Dade College Right after I graduated from Miami Senior High School with the hopes of studying game development. I quickly found out I did not enjoy the art classes I had to attend, it just was not for me, but I found myself really enjoying my C++ class. The counselors were helpful in explaining what carriers I change to that involved programming and I was suggested Database Administrator. When I changed my major I enjoyed the new classes I had to take even tho they were not easy. The first new class i had to take was Java which I felt was easier to learn since I had taken C++ before and I could call back to that knowledge. The second new class I took was SQL, and this is the class I had the most difficulty with at the time because it was different than anything I had seen before. In the end I felt disillusioned or just had a lack of motivation because I felt I was heading to a dead end with no real carrier path, and thats when my best friend's cousin introduced me to Turing School of Software & Design."

During the four and a half years working there I learned and experienced a wide variety of things. I mainly worked as a busser but filled in as a waiter when it got super busy and the waiters needed more help with tables. I was able to work well with a diverse group of people from many different backgrounds to get work done quickly and efficiently, I improved my communication skills attending to customers, along with learning how to better manage my time and dynamically prioritize tasks. Everyone I worked with is basically family and I wont forget my time there and all that I learned."
